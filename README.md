### AHP-based Sustainable Internal Procurement System

This project is an internal procurement system designed to promote sustainability using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) algorithm for decision-making and scoring.

#### Project Overview
Our internal procurement system aims to ensure that purchasing decisions are sustainable, efficient, and align with organizational goals. The AHP algorithm helps in evaluating multiple criteria to arrive at the best decision by structuring complex problems into a hierarchy and assigning weights to each criterion.

#### Features
- **AHP Algorithm Integration:** Utilizes the AHP algorithm for evaluating and scoring procurement options based on various sustainability criteria.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for internal stakeholders to input data and get recommendations.
- **Customizable Criteria:** Allows customization of evaluation criteria to fit different organizational needs and priorities.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation to guide users on how to use the system effectively.

#### File Structure
- **my-app-test:** Contains front-end application files.
- **backEnd:** Contains back-end application files, including the implementation of the AHP algorithm.
- **Document:** Documentation and guides related to the project.
- **README.md:** Project overview and instructions.

#### Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd Group_9_group9-main`
3. **Install dependencies:** Follow the installation instructions in the respective `my-app-test` and `backEnd` directories.
4. **Run the application:** Start both front-end and back-end applications as per the provided documentation.

#### Usage
